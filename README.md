# OperatingSystems
This repository contains C programs developed for various problems related to the subject of Operating Systems. These programs were created as part of a college course on Operating Systems, covering key concepts and implementations.

## ðŸ”§ How to compile the programs?
If you want to compile the programs, you need a C compiler. I recommend using **WSL** *(if you are using linux skip this part)* and installing the necessary tools with the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install build-essential  
```
This will install GCC and other essential compilers needed for building the programs.

You can install WSL by following this guide: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install
