# OperatingSystems
This repository contains C programs developed for various problems related to the subject of Operating Systems. These programs were created as part of a college course on Operating Systems, covering key concepts and implementations.

## ðŸ”§ How to Compile the Programs
To compile the programs, you need a C compiler. If you're using Linux, you likely already have the necessary tools. Windows users should install WSL and set up the required packages with:
```bash
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install build-essential  
```
This installs GCC and other essential build tools.

ðŸ‘‰ Install WSL by following this guide: [WSL Installation Guide.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

This project uses Makefiles to automate the build process.
